# AppleTV-MyAnimeList
MyAnimeList app for AppleTV rewritten in SwiftUI

### Requirements

- Xcode 12
- tvOS 14

### Development

The project use SwiftUI and SwiftUIFlux.

> [SwiftUIFlux](https://github.com/Dimillian/SwiftUIFlux): A very naive implementation of Redux using Combine BindableObject to serve as an example

You can learn SwiftUIFlux and SwiftUI with [MovieSwiftUI](https://github.com/Dimillian/MovieSwiftUI).

### Crunchyroll

You can stream videos from Crunchyroll. The following projects helped me a lot.

- [Crunchyroll Unblocker](https://cr-unblocker.us.to)
